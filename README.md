# **Supervised Regression Machine Learning for Ecommerce**

## Supervised Regression Machine Learning for Ecommerce Sales Increase

An e-commerce company sells products through its website and through its mobile app. To make a purchase, a customer registers on the portal (using a web site or app).

Each time the customer logs in, the system records the time he is logged in, whether in the app or on the website. For each customer the company keeps a record of sales with the total spent per month.

The company would like to increase sales, but the budget allows it to invest only in the website or app at this time.

## 1. BUSINESS PROBLEMS

In this project we will carry out all the steps of the process of construction, training, evaluation and selection of models for regression. 

The entire process will be demonstrated from end to end, from the definition of the business problem, to the interpretation of the model and delivery of the result to the decision maker.

Our main objective is to improve the customer experience while browsing the system, increasing the time logged in, increasing engagement and, consequently, increasing sales.

## 2. BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS

The data used in this project are fictitious, but represent real data for e-commerce companies. 

The data represents a month of operation of the ecommerce portal. 

The title of each column in the dataset is self-explanatory.
